# Pulse IO Game

A creative, minimal JavaScript io game inspired by Agar.io and Slither.io â€” but with unique mechanics:
- Finite world (2000x2000)
- Camera follows and zooms on the player
- AI blobs that compete for crystals
- Pings reveal hidden crystals and push AI away
- Speed scales with size
- Smooth controls with velocity easing
- Ends when health too low

ðŸš€ **Tech:**  
- Vanilla JavaScript (Canvas API)
- No libraries

ðŸŽ¯ **Play:**  
Just open `index.html` in your browser.
